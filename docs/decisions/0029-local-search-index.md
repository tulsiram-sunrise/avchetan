# 0029 — Plain search uses a local full-text index that isn't synced

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-11-10
- **Builds on:** [ADR-0004](0004-outbox-sync-lww.md) (sync), [ADR-0016](0016-deployment-modes-home-hub.md) (deployment modes)

## Context
Users need to find what they wrote without a model ([finding and using data](../product/finding-and-using-data.md#1-plain-search)). Ask is slow on a processor, and the hub's meaning search (`POST /v1/search`) needs a reachable hub with embeddings, so it fails offline and in Standalone. The existing `searchLogs` query scans every entry with `instr(lower(content))`: no ranking, no partial words, and slow on years of entries.

## Decision
- Each client (PC and phone) keeps a **SQLite FTS5 index** over entry text, task titles and people's names. It is client-only: not synced, not on the server, rebuilt from the synced tables at any time.
- The index is kept in step by **SQLite triggers** on `raw_logs`, `tasks` and `entities`, so rows written by repositories and rows applied by sync are both covered, and a soft delete (`deleted_at`) removes the row from the index. It is created and filled from existing rows by a SQLite-only migration.
- Tokenizer: `unicode61` with prefix queries. If the performance baseline shows Hindi in Devanagari isn't found word by word, `trigram` is used instead; the choice is recorded in the roadmap.
- The hub's meaning search stays as an optional second section, never awaited by the word results.
- `searchLogs` (used by Ask's `search_entries` tool) moves onto the index.

## Alternatives considered
- Keep `instr` / `LIKE`: no ranking, no partial words, a full scan per keystroke.
- Server-only search: fails offline and in Standalone, against "works with zero paid services" and offline first.
- On-device vectors (`sqlite-vec`, [Q3](../open-questions.md)): needs embeddings on every device; meaning search stays on the hub for now.

## Consequences
- The FTS table is an exception to "schema changes touch both dialects": it's not a synced table and exists only on clients. The schema parity test lists it as client-only.
- The database grows by roughly a third of the entry text. A reset or restore rebuilds the index.
- Private entries are in the index (it's on the device, like the entries); the app filters them out while locked.
- No new dependency: FTS5 is in the SQLite builds both apps already use (rusqlite `bundled`, `expo-sqlite`); this is verified on Day 1.
